    <h1>About</h1>
        <div class="line"></div>
        <p>I am S. NIthin. I live with my parents and sweet sister. I am now 12 years old and at grade 7. I am a professional skater. I also play chess. My craze to physical fitness took me to the world of Karate and now I own a black belt.  My mother always complain that I keep running and pushing inside the house but guess what it has done to me, it has made me a good athelet.  Solving maths puzzles always fills me with happiness. They always makes me busy and active. My sister always puts forward a puzzle.(note: her trick to make make me calm and quiet). She says let the house stay in peace, but I enjoy it a lot.  At present I have stepped into the world of coding. My coding lessons fill me with surprises and it has something new to be learned everyday. Apart from this I do gardening.  Mamma always says do some learning also Nithin. She is always at the back of me with Science, HIstory, Geography, Malayalam,.........never ending. My  day starts with a fight with dad. He makes me read the Newspaper for him.  A tough time we children face everyday (Elders please....).

            <p>Gardening is my favourite hobby. Inspired from my father we have a small organic vegetable farm at the backyard of my house. New vegetables springing up in my plants always fills me with happiness. It is a pride to grow, harvest and share them with our neighbours. I feel happy to see many organic veggie farms developing in my neighbourhood. We people in our locality share our harvest with each other. This has helped us to have organic food even during this lockdown.  " Grow more plants,  they  keep you healthy and fills your world with happiness and peace".</p>
